## NCBI_PcrA_temperature_mapping
This project involves processing and merging biological datasets to analyze organism-specific properties. The key functionalities include:

- Loading datasets from CSV files containing organism and temperature information.
- Harmonizing data by renaming columns for compatibility.
- Merging datasets based on organism names.
- Exporting the combined results to a new CSV file for further analysis.

**This project is designed to facilitate insights into temperature-related characteristics of various organisms by integrating data from NCBI and other sources.**
