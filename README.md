## NCBI PcrA temperature mapping

> This project is designed to facilitate insights into temperature-related characteristics of various organisms by integrating data from NCBI and other sources.

The key functionalities include:
- Loading datasets from CSV files containing organism and temperature information.
- Harmonizing data by renaming columns for compatibility.
- Merging datasets based on organism names.
- Exporting the combined results to a new CSV file for further analysis.
